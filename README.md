# CPUMiner-Startup

A bash script to clone, build and run [tpruvot/cpuminer-multi](https://github.com/tpruvot/cpuminer-multi) in Debian/Ubuntu for my personal utility.

Putting it here just for convenience to deploy. No one was expected to care it.

```sh
wget -N --no-check-certificate  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdfmlr/CPUMiner-Startup/master/startup.sh && bash startup.sh
```

**Note**: Running this without any modification will drive your miner works for me!
